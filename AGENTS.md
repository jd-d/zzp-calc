# Agent Guidelines

- When checking off an item in `TODO.md`, move the completed task to a `DONE` section and note the completion date.
- Always update `TODO.md` when adding, completing, or removing tasks so it reflects the current plan.
- When proposing future work items or responding to planning requests, avoid bundling large multi-step refactors into a single task; prefer a sequence of smaller, actionable tasks instead.
